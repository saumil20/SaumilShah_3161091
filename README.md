# Project of number guessing game
## Purpose: 
The user is prompted to guess a random number between 1 and 100 by this program. The program provides feedback and prompts the user to guess again if their guess is too high or too low. The program prints the number of attempts required and ends when the user correctly guesses the number. Additionally, the program provides the user with the option to quit the game at any time by typing "q."

## The most effective method to Use

1. Open the Python file that includes the application.
2. Start the software.
3. The user will be asked to guess a number between 1 and 100 by the program.
4. The user should enter their estimate and press enter.
5. If the user's guess was too high or too low, the program will tell them and ask them to guess again.
6. Steps 4 through 5 are repeated until the player either correctly guesses the number or exits the game.
7. The program will print a congratulatory message along with the number of attempts required if the user guesses the correct number.
8. The program will print a message letting the user know that the game is ending if the user quits.

## Requirements/Dependencies

This program requires Python to be introduced on the users's PC.
